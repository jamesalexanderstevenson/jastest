202009251931: in lavaland, there was a mod called map.  in this mod,
i would hold current right-clicked node.  here in jastest, i believe
this exists in some mod.  if not i need to create it, probably in
server mod.  thing is, beds mod has beds.sel, duplicating this
capability.

202009200856: fix mobs menu, particularly for when the mob has died
a cooldown period is there, but it isn't obvious, and not particularly
functional.

Now that I've made it so you can interact with objects while wielding
the backpacks and walkie talkie, I'd like to make the walkie talkie
inspect items when clicking.  Right now, for example, it will trigger
a mechanism because it has an on_punch, but will fail to pick up a torch.

Not only would I like to be able to dig_immediate, it'd also be fun
and, I think, interesting to give some data feedback based on what you
clicked.  If I click a sheep with the walkie, perhaps I can get a little
story or information.  If I click wood planks with a walkie, again I
could show some more information.
